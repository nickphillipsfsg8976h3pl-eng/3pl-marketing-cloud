	Every student learns differently and Reading Eggs makes it easy to meet each one exactly where they are.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	At Kula Elementary, teacher Lisa Silva discovered exactly this: &quot;<i>The differentiation in Reading Eggs is something I really appreciate because students are all at different levels</i>,&quot; she notes. &quot;<i>I love that the initial testing places students into what they know and where they need to go.</i>&quot;&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	Here's how you can achieve the same results in your classroom:&nbsp;<br>
	<b>&#129504; Personalised pathways&nbsp;</b><br>
	Placement tests ensure students start at the perfect level based on ability - not age. Lessons adjust based on responses, challenging advanced readers while supporting those needing more practice.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<b>&#128218; Comprehensive content and digital library&nbsp;</b><br>
	Reading Eggs, Reading Eggspress and Fast Phonics target phonics to comprehension, plus 4000+ eBooks (including 350+ decodable readers) at varying levels match student ability and interests.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<b>⚖️ Perfect balance of independence &amp; control&nbsp;</b><br>
	Students explore games, books and activities at their own pace, while teachers maintain full control to assign specific lessons, books and assessments targeting individual learning goals.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<b>&#128202; Data-backed insights that drive action&nbsp;</b><br>
	Real-time reporting reveals each student's strengths, gaps and growth, helping you group students effectively, assign targeted resources and provide the support each learner needs.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<b>&#127919; Built-In motivation &amp; mastery&nbsp;</b><br>
	Golden eggs, certificates and immediate feedback keep students engaged while regular mastery checks ensure retention, automatically redirecting students to review when needed.&nbsp;<p paraeid="{aa5e6ada-d0a7-42aa-bd12-3037ffc6e944}{135}" paraid="342589397">

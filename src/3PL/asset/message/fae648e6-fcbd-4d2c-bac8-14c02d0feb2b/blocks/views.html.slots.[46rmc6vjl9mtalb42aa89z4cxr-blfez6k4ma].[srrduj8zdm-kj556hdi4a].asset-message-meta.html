	I&rsquo;m Alastair, and I&rsquo;m the team leader for a team of developers (and one tester) called Team Kraken. We work on developing student-facing applications, like Reading Eggs and Mathseeds. A typical day for me involves a lot of Zoom meetings with team members, project managers, and other stakeholders, as well as lots of Jira. I still code when I can, too!&nbsp;<br>

	We moved from Melbourne to Broome late last year so that my partner could be nearer to her family. We&rsquo;re still finding our feet up here but gradually settling in. It&rsquo;s probably the smallest town I&rsquo;ve ever lived in - small enough that we don&rsquo;t have mailboxes here; everyone just goes to the post office a couple of times a week to collect their mail - and definitely feels quite remote. Broome is very far north; we&rsquo;re in Western Australia but closer on a map to Bali than we are to Perth (and driving to Perth is not for the faint of heart). The weather is tropical - currently, we&rsquo;re in the wet season, so we&rsquo;re experiencing thunderstorms, humidity, and the occasional tropical cyclone.&nbsp;<br>

	Broome has a pretty interesting history. Pearl diving was a big deal during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including the old hard-hat type diving. Divers came from diverse cultural backgrounds, including Aboriginal Australians, Indonesians, and Japanese. There are plenty of nods to both this cultural diversity and the legacy of the pearl industry dotted about town (think lots of pearl-related business names and hard-hat logos everywhere, for example). There&rsquo;s also an annual Shinju Matsuri festival (Japanese for &ldquo;festival of the pearl&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p><p paraeid="{4950ca14-980d-41b1-929f-2a75891c85f9}{199}" paraid="2097812744">
	Going further back in time, Broome is also situated next to a dinosaur track. You can go and see the 120-million-year-old footprints they left along the coast in what has since become sandstone.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></table>

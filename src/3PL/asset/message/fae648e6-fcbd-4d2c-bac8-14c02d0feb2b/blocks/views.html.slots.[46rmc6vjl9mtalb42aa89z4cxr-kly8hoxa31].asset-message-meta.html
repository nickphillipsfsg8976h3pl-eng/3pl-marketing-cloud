	Before 3P, I worked extensively in eLearning and HR tech, and what drew me here was the mission. During Covid, ours were the only tools my children would engage with, and I loved the gamification aspect. Education has the power to transform lives, and I saw this role as an opportunity to contribute to that while driving growth in the APAC region.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	The most rewarding part of joining 3P has been seeing our direct impact on students and educators. Every conversation I have - whether with a teacher, school leader, or team member - reinforces the importance of what we do. I&rsquo;ve also loved the collaborative culture and the passion within our team.<br>
	<br>
	An unexpected (and pleasant!) surprise has been the company's agility. Despite being well-established, there&rsquo;s a real willingness to innovate, test new ideas, and adapt quickly.&nbsp;Another unexpected aspect has been the deep relationships we have with educators - it&rsquo;s not just about selling a product; it&rsquo;s being a true partner.</p><p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{ffcaa270-fdce-4822-9d13-43bac87ac017}{84}" paraid="1816678155" xml:lang="EN-US">
	For me, leadership is about trust and empowerment. I believe in coaching rather than micromanaging - helping individuals recognise their strengths, set ambitious goals, and continuously grow.&nbsp;I set high expectations but ensure my team has the resources, training, and guidance to succeed. My door is always open for my whole team, and feedback and honest conversations are key.&nbsp;I follow Marshall Goldsmith&rsquo;s philosophy of continuous improvement.</p><p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{255bc77c-ec76-438f-b51d-9f1be6ae762b}{80}" paraid="1131143155" xml:lang="EN-US">
	Early in my career, I thought being a leader meant providing all the solutions, but I&rsquo;ve learned that the most impactful leaders listen, ask insightful questions, and guide teams toward their own solutions. That shift in mindset inspired me to invest in myself and become a leadership coach so I could impact others. If I could offer one piece of advice to aspiring leaders, it would be to be proactive about your own development. Don&rsquo;t wait for opportunities - create them. Seek mentors, ask for feedback, and take on challenges outside your comfort zone. Leadership isn&rsquo;t about a title; it&rsquo;s about mindset and action, so be adaptable, keep learning, and be comfortable being uncomfortable!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{8e9f7d30-7710-42ce-ae08-e6bd6f1c8553}{69}" paraid="1658656029" xml:lang="EN-US">
	Looking ahead, I'm passionate about expanding our reach to help more students, teachers, and schools succeed across APAC. Personally, I&rsquo;m also continuing to develop as a leader, particularly in the areas of coaching and change management. I see<b> </b>every challenge as an opportunity to learn, and I look forward to growing alongside my team and the company. A professional goal of mine is to complete the Company Directors Course and encourage more women to step into leadership. &nbsp;</p></td></tr></table>

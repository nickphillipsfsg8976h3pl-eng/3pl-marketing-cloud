	<i>&quot;My ADHDer was getting lost in large classroom instruction and hated the tricky little readers from school. She&rsquo;s a creative soul who wanted to tell an intricate story, not just sound out CVC words. We started Reading Eggs in the Easter holidays, and she quickly caught up. She&rsquo;s continued since and is making great progress, doing it a few times a week and extra during school holidays.&quot;</i></p></td></tr></table>

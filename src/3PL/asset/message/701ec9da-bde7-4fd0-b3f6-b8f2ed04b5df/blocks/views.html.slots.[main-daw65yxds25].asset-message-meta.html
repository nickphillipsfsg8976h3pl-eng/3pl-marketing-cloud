	If you&rsquo;ve taken a look around BambooHR lately, you might&rsquo;ve spotted a brand-new feature in the Performance tab, designed to make your 1:1 meetings more structured, collaborative, and impactful.&nbsp;<br>

	Stu McPherson, our Sales Manager &ndash; Growth (UK), has been loving the tool, so we asked him to share how he&rsquo;s using it with his team. His approach might just give you a few ideas to try - whether you&rsquo;re leading 1:1s or preparing for them as a team member.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></table>

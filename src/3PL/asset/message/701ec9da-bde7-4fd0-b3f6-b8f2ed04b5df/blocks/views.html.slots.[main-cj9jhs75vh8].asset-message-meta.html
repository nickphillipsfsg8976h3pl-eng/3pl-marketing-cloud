	Welcome to a new financial year!&nbsp;</p><p data-end="78" data-start="64" style="line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">
	We achieved some good milestones in FY25 despite tougher economic and competitive conditions across all regions for B2B and B2C.&nbsp;</p><ul role="list">

			For APAC, we launched <i>3 Essentials </i>(3E) and moved all schools to the new 3E Identity and Roster system and 3E interface in early February 2025. This was a monumental job, so full credit goes to the Sales, Customer Service, and Product &amp; Technology teams. As at the end of June, 450 schools had upgraded to 3E, which bodes well for the upcoming selling season.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul role="list">

			EMEA has recently started its migration to 3E in similar fashion.&nbsp;<br>
			We expect some teething issues over the next few months but, so far, about 50 schools have signed up for 3E and most of them are new customers, which is a positive sign of the 3E&rsquo;s better positioning and pricing options for EMEA. We should also be able to deliver the much-requested Wonde integration in the next six months.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul role="list">

			AMER is going through its first full renewal season for <i>Reading Eggs</i> school customers in the US, since taking over that book of business from Edmentum in February 2024, while Canada managed a great retention rate for B2B at 91%, which is a great result. The team is seeing solid opportunities in the US and Canada for FY26, particularly given the recent upgrades to <i>Mathletics </i>District Reporting and the Classlink integration release. Canada has recently started its migration to 3E.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul role="list">

			Not to be outdone, B2C launched Homeschool Max in the US in May and secured several ESA approvals (including Texas, Arizona, and Wyoming) with more to come. &nbsp;<br>
			The initial market response has been very positive, and we see this as a significant growth opportunity for B2C.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p paraeid="{0ee2b074-8992-47c0-8835-4ad0411c2ffa}{223}" paraid="794368568" style="line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">
	On the People &amp; Culture front, we also launched our Extended Leadership Team program to recognise and help us develop our future Senior Leaders. The team met in Sydney in late April to become familiar with our Strategic Planning Process and has already taken an active role in our FY26 budget and strategy execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p paraeid="{e3278db5-0efb-408e-9d60-4fe5837e0dd1}{4}" paraid="1799434913" style="line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">
	In addition, we acquired <i>LiteracyPlanet </i>in January 2025 and have since restructured it, together with <i>Brightpath</i>, as business units with dedicated resources to set them up for success.&nbsp;</p><p paraeid="{e3278db5-0efb-408e-9d60-4fe5837e0dd1}{32}" paraid="1976951508" style="line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">
	These are some of the highlights for the year, but every part of the company has contributed to these achievements and then some, so a BIG congrats to everyone.&nbsp;</p><p paraeid="{e3278db5-0efb-408e-9d60-4fe5837e0dd1}{50}" paraid="1637107599" style="line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">
	Unfortunately, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in previous comms, the financial scoreboard for FY25 did not fully reflect the benefits of this work. We&rsquo;re likely to wrap up FY25 with no revenue growth relative to FY24, but improved profitability and cash generation.&nbsp;</p><p paraeid="{e3278db5-0efb-408e-9d60-4fe5837e0dd1}{68}" paraid="212613592" style="line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">
	To respond to this challenge, we have reviewed all areas of the business and identified cost savings as well as opportunities to help us grow from FY26 and beyond. The SLT and ELT have worked together to represent, on one page, our strategic priorities for the year ahead.&nbsp;</p><p paraeid="{e3278db5-0efb-408e-9d60-4fe5837e0dd1}{92}" paraid="1044820472" style="line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">
	We have called this our new Strategy House, and it covers our company purpose, key markets and segments, and the four strategic pillars. The foundations of the house represent our People &amp; Culture, Processes, and Reporting.</p></td></tr></table>

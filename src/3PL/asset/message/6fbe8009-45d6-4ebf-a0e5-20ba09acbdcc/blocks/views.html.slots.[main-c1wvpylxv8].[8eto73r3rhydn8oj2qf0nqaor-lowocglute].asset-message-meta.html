	Over the past few weeks, our team has had the incredible privilege of visiting schools across the UK and Ireland and honestly, it&rsquo;s been the most rewarding part of our year.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	From leading student assemblies to running teacher training and presenting awards, these visits have reminded us of the magic happening every day in classrooms like yours. We&rsquo;ve seen:&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	✨ <b>Students bursting with pride</b> as they&rsquo;re recognised for their progress&nbsp;<br>
	&#128105;&zwj;&#127979; <b>Teachers feeling seen and supported</b>, with practical guidance that lifts their practice&nbsp;<br>
	&#127979; &nbsp;<b>School leaders inspired</b> by the positive momentum to provide an ambitious vision for their pupils.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	These celebrations go beyond programmes; they&rsquo;re about partnership, shared wins, and real impact.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<i>&ldquo;After the assembly at Balborough Hall, I had teacher after teacher coming up and thanking me for breathing fresh life into Mathletics (and for coming to see them 10-years ago)&hellip;&hellip;I assured them it was all of the hard work that they put in as educators that made the real difference. I congratulated them on how efficiently they are utilising Mathletics and how we are always there to support&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><br>

	<i>&quot;The pupils were very well mannered, and very excited to receive their certificates, and there was one child in particular who's face showed genuine shock and surprise when she was announced as the highest scorer - it turns out she had broken her leg earlier in the year, and had spent most of her time recovering playing on Mathletics, with a total score of 207,000 points!! The kids were also really eager to find out what type of 'Legend' Certificate they were going to receive after their fifth - it was great to see their excitement!&quot;</i><br>

	We know your school has been with us for a number of years, and we&rsquo;d love to reconnect, not just to talk about what&rsquo;s next, but to celebrate how far you&rsquo;ve come.&nbsp;<br>

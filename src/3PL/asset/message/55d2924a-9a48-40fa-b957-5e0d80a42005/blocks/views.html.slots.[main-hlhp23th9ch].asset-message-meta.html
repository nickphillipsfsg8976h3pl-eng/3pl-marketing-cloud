	<i>&ldquo;My son was the youngest in kindergarten and was struggling. Reading Eggs helped him catch up so much so that his teacher said his report card didn&rsquo;t reflect where he was at. Teacher said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what has happened but John has progressed so much over the past two weeks since I did his report&rdquo;. I then told her it was due to Reading Eggs. She was amazed.&rdquo;<br>

	<i>&ldquo;I was skeptical at first, but I love how the kids' daily reads are logged automatically once they finish books. It tracks their progress as well as making it super easy to understand where they are in reading and math. Easy to navigate and they have TONS of printouts available which is awesome. The kids love &ldquo;playing&rdquo; with Reading Eggs before class - it wakes them up, gets them ready, and gets them ahead for the day with their assignments &#129392;<br>
	I&rsquo;m a happy momma for sure!<br>

	<i>&ldquo;The individual aspect of Reading Eggs is priceless, really. Kids being able to work on their own, at their own individual speed and choose the books that they like. I mean, no paper library can really provide that in the same way.&rdquo;<br>

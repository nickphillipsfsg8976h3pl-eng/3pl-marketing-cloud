	individual. It allows you to create as many agenda points as you like, and allows the individual to capture their responses to these.<br>
	<br>
	Equally you can leave it blank, or set a broad agenda; mine is always:<br>
	<br>
	<b>&quot;Our 1-1&rsquo;s will focus on performance improvement. Please come prepared with your thoughts on how we can partner together to work on this&quot;.</b><br>
	<br>
	I then use the tool to capture the outputs of the discussion so this can be referred back to, especially if you are wanting to measure growth, or capture the specific items of support that you as a leader need to own and deliver.<br>
	<br>
	For anyone using the feature for the first time, the only advice I&rsquo;d give is to think about whether you want reoccurring agenda items, or what is important for each individual role that you want to focus on during these conversations.<br>
	<br>
	My approach is that one-to-ones should be owned solely by the team member, and therefore a good starting place is to ask:</p><p data-end="2118" data-start="2093" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%;">
	<b>1. What&rsquo;s important to them?</b></p><p data-end="2163" data-start="2123" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%;">
	<b>2. How would they like to use the template?</b></p><p data-end="2238" data-start="2168" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%;">
	<b>3. Are there recurring agenda items they&rsquo;d like to include ahead of time?</b></p><div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%;">
	Then build it accordingly!&quot;</div></td></tr></table>

	At one Reading Eggs school, a teacher explains how Reading Eggs has improved student outcomes: &quot;<i>Our children are no longer afraid of reading. They now love to read and because they're reading more, their results have improved</i>.&quot;&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height: 150%;">
	<br>
	Here's how you can do the same!&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	&#128218;<b> Start with Placement Tests&nbsp;</b><br>
	<br>
	Before starting, have your students complete their <b>Placement Test </b>to:&nbsp;</div><ul>
	<li style="line-height: 150%;">
		Show you exactly where each student needs support&nbsp;</li><li style="line-height: 150%;">
		Eliminate guesswork about readiness&nbsp;</li><li style="line-height: 150%;">
		Save you from re-teaching concepts students already understand.&nbsp;</li></ul><div style="line-height: 150%;">
	<b>Need to reset a Placement Test?</b> If a student needs to retake their placement test, you can easily reset it from your dashboard. Simply log in to your <b>Teacher Dashboard</b>, click &lsquo;Management&rsquo;, then select &lsquo;Manage Progress&rsquo;. Click &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; next to the student's name, choose &lsquo;Placement Test&rsquo; under &lsquo;My Lessons&rsquo;, and don't forget to click &lsquo;Save changes&rsquo; to give them a fresh start.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	&#127919;<b> Build the weekly habit:&nbsp;</b></div><ul>
	<li style="line-height: 150%;">
		Encourage your students to log in at least 3 times per week&nbsp;</li><li style="line-height: 150%;">
		Challenge them to earn 1000 points through their <b>Weekly Quest&nbsp;</b></li><li style="line-height: 150%;">
		Celebrate certificates to maintain momentum!&nbsp;</li></ul><div style="line-height: 150%;">

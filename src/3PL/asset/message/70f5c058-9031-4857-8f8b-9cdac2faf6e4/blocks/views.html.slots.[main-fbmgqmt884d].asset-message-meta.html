	Every classroom has diverse learning needs. One teacher shares how Reading Eggs handles mixed-ability classrooms: &quot;<i>Reading Eggs has been a life saver for our varied ability classroom. Since the lessons are very accessible, it&rsquo;s easy for my students to do independently and because they all follow their own path, it&rsquo;s ok that some students are beyond others.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>

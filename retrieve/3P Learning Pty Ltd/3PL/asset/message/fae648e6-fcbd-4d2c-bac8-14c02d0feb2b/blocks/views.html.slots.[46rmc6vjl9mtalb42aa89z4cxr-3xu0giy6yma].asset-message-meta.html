                There's a reason <i>Creating Lifelong Learners</i> is a 3P value and a pillar of
                what we do. Continuous learning and development is good for us as people &ndash; and
                honestly, it&rsquo;s great for 3P too.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                In our 2024 Pea-ple Voice survey we had our highest overall engagement result to
                date (80%), driven by high favorability scores between 86-94% related to work life
                blend, 3P values, individual managers, inclusion and social connection.
                Particularly, relating to development, feedback and recognition our scores were 73%
                favourable. So, in&nbsp;December 2024, we launched the&nbsp;<b
                    >Thrive &amp; Grow Portal</b
                >&nbsp;on 3PYOU - a personalised development hub designed to guide and empower you
                in shaping your own growth journey.&nbsp;

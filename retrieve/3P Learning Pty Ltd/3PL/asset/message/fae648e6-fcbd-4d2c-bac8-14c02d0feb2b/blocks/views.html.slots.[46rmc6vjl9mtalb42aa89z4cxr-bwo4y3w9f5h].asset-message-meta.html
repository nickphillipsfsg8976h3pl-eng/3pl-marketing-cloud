                I&rsquo;m extremely grateful that 3P was so open to the idea of me moving to a
                small, remote town in Northern Australia! We never would have been able to make the
                move without the business&rsquo;s support.&nbsp;<br />

                3P&rsquo;s flexibility with working hours has also been great. Moving to a tropical
                climate and changing time zones by three hours has had its challenges. Being able to
                experiment in order to find what works best for me has been really helpful. For now,
                I have taken to starting work here early in the morning (WA time) so that I can
                knock off early as well and then take a nana nap in the afternoon when the heat is
                at its worst. This keeps me from getting too grumpy and also allows me to keep hours
                that are close to the Sydney ones, minimising the impact on my team.&nbsp;

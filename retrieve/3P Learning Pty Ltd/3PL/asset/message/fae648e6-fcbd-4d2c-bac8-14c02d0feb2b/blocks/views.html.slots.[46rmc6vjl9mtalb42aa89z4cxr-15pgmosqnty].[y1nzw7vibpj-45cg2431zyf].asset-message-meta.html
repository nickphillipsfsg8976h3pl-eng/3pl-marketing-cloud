            I originally wanted to be a Biologist! After uni I quickly realised that stepping into
            David Attenborough&rsquo;s shoes wasn&rsquo;t an option, so I started as a recruitment
            consultant and I loved it. Sales is about caring about your customer and finding
            solutions &ndash; and so my career in sales unwittingly&nbsp;began!&nbsp;

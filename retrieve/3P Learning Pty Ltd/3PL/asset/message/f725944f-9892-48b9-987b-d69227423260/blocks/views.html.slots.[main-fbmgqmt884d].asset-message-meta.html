                            Every student learns differently and Mathletics
                            makes it easy to meet each one exactly where they
                            are.&nbsp;<br />

                            At Calvary Christian School, teacher Elise Vargas
                            discovered exactly this:
                            <i
                                >&quot;Mathletics does a really great job of
                                targeting students where they're at and where
                                they need to go next. It allows us to
                                differentiate and extend those students who need
                                to go further by using multiple aspects of the
                                program.&quot;&nbsp;</i

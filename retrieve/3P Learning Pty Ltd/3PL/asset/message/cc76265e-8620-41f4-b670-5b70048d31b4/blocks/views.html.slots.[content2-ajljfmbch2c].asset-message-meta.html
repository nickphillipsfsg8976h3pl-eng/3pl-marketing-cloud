                                    applications of what is being studied. We
                                    can explain that there is geometry and
                                    algebra everywhere in construction and
                                    engineering. We can point to needing to know
                                    percentages or fractions to work out if
                                    sales are worth it. There&rsquo;s even the
                                    obvious need for addition and
                                    subtraction.</span

                                    and needing to use maths in their jobs. Then

                                    math class on a Friday afternoon.</span

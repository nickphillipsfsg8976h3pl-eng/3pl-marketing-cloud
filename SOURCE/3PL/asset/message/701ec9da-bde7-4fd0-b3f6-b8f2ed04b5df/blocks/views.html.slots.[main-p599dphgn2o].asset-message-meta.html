	<b>Jenny Stassi&nbsp;</b>from our B2C Customer Support team in the US is truly our very own Elphaba - unapologetically herself, kind, compassionate, and always authentic. Also, Jenny literally played Elphaba in <i>Wicked&nbsp;</i>on Broadway and around the world for 20 years before joining us! As both a performer and a mother, she brings deep empathy and star power to every customer interaction and internal initiative. Whether supporting our customers or creating a web series with the social media team, Jenny&rsquo;s warmth and sincerity always shine through, making her an incredible asset to the team.<br>

	<b>Julia Funk </b>who joined us with <i>LiteracyPlanet</i>, has embodied authenticity from day one. She takes everything in stride with humour, grace, and a can-do attitude. Julia stepped into new roles and responsibilities seamlessly this half, even supporting onboarding and stepping in as manager while still new herself! Her openness, willingness to share, and approachable style have already built deep trust and strong connections across the team in only a short time.&nbsp;</div></td></tr></table>

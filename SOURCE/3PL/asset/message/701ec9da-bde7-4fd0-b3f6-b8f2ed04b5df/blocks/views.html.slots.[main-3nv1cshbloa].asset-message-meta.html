	<b>Mire Fukumoto&nbsp;</b>from our Development Team (based in the US) has been an invaluable addition since she the day she joined us. Despite working remotely, Mire&rsquo;s deep knowledge and eagerness to share it help her foster strong connections and support her team in achieving both personal and collective goals. Her selfless attitude and inclusive spirit create a truly empowering environment where everyone feels inspired to succeed together. Mire&rsquo;s generosity, collaborative nature, and ability to embody the <i>Thrive Together</i> spirit from afar perfectly represent this value.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Paul McLellan,&nbsp;</b>also&nbsp;from our Development Team (based in Australia), is the epitome of a team player. Calm, supportive, and humble, Paul guides his colleagues through complex cross-functional projects with patience and clarity. He jumps in at all hours when needed, communicates openly, and builds a strong sense of unity and trust across different teams. Always focused on solutions and never seeking the spotlight, Paul strengthens 3P every day and perfectly represents what it means to thrive together.</div><div style="line-height: 115%; text-align: center;">

	In previous years, our LOVE Award winners have stepped away with their very own 3P Converse sneakers. With our supplier no longer available, we&rsquo;re working on a new prize - so stay tuned for details coming soon.<br>
	<br>
	As always, the LOVE Awards will be back in December, and it&rsquo;s never too early to start thinking about who you might want to nominate next!&nbsp;</div><p data-end="1905" data-start="1649">

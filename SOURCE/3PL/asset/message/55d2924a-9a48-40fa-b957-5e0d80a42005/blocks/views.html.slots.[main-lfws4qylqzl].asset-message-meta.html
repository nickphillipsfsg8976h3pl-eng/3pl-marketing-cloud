	<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">engaging resources (for grammar, no less!), Laura helped us find better ways to learn that were truly impactful.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	Beyond her professional expertise as an English and History teacher, Laura has enriched our team with her thoughtful presence and quiet strength. Her wisdom has always extended beyond the written word, into the realms of the heart, the spirit and the unseen. Laura has an extraordinary gift for helping others find clarity, balance and perspective, blending her love of teaching with her deep connection to the metaphysical world. She reminded us often that learning is not only about knowledge, but also about meaning, energy and the light we bring to others.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	As grateful as we are for her gifts these last 15 years, and as undeniable as our excitement is for her next chapter, we selfishly hoped she&rsquo;d stay with us forever. Thank you, Laura, for sharing your joy for life, your powerful earthly wisdom, and your ability to make us pause and see the extraordinary in the everyday. We will miss seeing you each day, but we look forward to your stories of travel, reflection and adventure as you continue to inspire us all from near or far.&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr></table>

	It has been a busy first quarter as we ramp up our focus on delivering our <a alias="FY26 strategy" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://3p.continu.co/file/6864f3075eb4a67ea01c770d" style="color:#7FBF3F;text-decoration:underline;" title="FY26 strategy">FY26 strategy</a>, as well as updating investors, analysts, and shareholders on our FY25 results.<br>
	<br>
	Since the start of FY26, we&rsquo;ve had our B2B sales conferences and Northern Ireland Roadshow, and have wrapped up sales for Q1 in all regions.<br>
	AMER is showing good preliminary results for Q1 billings, while EMEA is starting to get traction with 3 Essentials (3E), particularly for new business.<br>
	The B2B selling season for APAC of course will get into full swing in Q2, so look out for an update closer to December.<br>
	<br>
	B2C is still facing some challenges but we continue to see sales growth and further opportunity from Homeschool Max in the US, and have now secured approved funding status in 13 US states.<br>
	<br>
	On the product and tech side, we have released new MX district standards reporting, 3E cross program reporting, launched Classlink integration in the US, released a churn risk report in Salesforce, new standards reports for Brightpath Maths, and SSO for NSW DoE for LiteracyPlanet.<br>
	<br>
	We also completed our 2025 Pea-ple Voice survey, with a very strong 89% participation rate. Thank you to everyone who contributed their thoughts. Our 2025 engagement score of 76% is a very strong result.&nbsp;<br>
	3P&rsquo;s approach to flexible working is hands down our most loved category, followed by the strength of our people leaders, the way we live our values and our inclusive culture.<br>
	<br>
	We have some continuing work to do around streamlining processes and enablement as well as improving our approach to managing the ongoing change we face as a company.<br>
	We are also mindful that you would like to see more around how we action your feedback. To help us do this, our Extended Leadership Team will be taking a bigger role in unpacking localised survey results with their teams and working with you on action planning.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	To wrap up on a very positive note, a BIG Congrats to our one-of-a-kind Chief Product Officer, Katy Pike, on her 30-year anniversary with the 3P group of companies.<br>
	Katy&rsquo;s journey, from her early days in book publishing and authoring, through global success with Reading Eggs and Mathseeds, to now when her programs continue to impact and benefit millions of children, students, parents and educators around the world, has seen nothing but creativity, passion, fun and sheer hard work.&nbsp;<br>
	We thank Katy for everything she has contributed to make our company what it is today, and for what&rsquo;s to come.</p><p data-end="78" data-start="64" style="line-height: 115%; text-align: right;">

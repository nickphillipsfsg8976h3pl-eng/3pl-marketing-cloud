</h2><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Over the next five years, our bonds with Jane grew even deeper. From her visits to Australia where she gave some of the best in-person training and product refreshers our APAC teams had ever received, to us visiting the Bristol office, Jane always welcomed us like family. She ensured we met the right people, had the right support, and, of course, shared wonderful meals and drinks together.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Jane&rsquo;s impact has been extraordinary. In a company of nearly 400 employees, I&rsquo;d wager at least half knew her personally, and many cherished their own connection with her. She didn&rsquo;t just dedicate herself to our products; she dedicated herself to us, often bringing handmade craft kits and thoughtful gifts for our children.&nbsp;</span><br>
